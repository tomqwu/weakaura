# weakaura

Hand-built, programmatically generated WeakAuras for WoW Classic (TBC Anniversary).
Every import string here is produced by Lua build scripts through the exact WeakAuras
serialization pipeline, verified by round-trip decode before commit — no hand-edited
exports, no custom code beyond a single one-line trigger combinator.

## Structure

```
tbc/<class>/           one folder per class
  ├── *.txt            importable "!WA:2!" strings — copy the whole file, /wa → Import
  └── generate.lua     the build script that produced the string
tools/tbc-weakaura-creator/
                       the generator toolkit + verified schema references + gotchas;
                       also packaged as a Claude skill (see its SKILL.md)
```

## Packs

- **tbc/rogue/all-specs.txt** — full HUD, v40 of a 40-iteration build: health/energy/threat
  bars with 35/40 energy threshold lines, combo pips (gold at 5), spec-adaptive cooldown row
  (15 spells, talent-gated, tooltips + keybind labels), animated alert flow (SnD missing,
  Riposte window, Feint-at-70%-threat, Evasion-below-50%-HP), weapon enchant proc tracker
  with clones, out-of-combat fade. Locale-independent (pure spell-ID matching, built on a
  zhCN client). Combat / Mutilate / Subtlety auto-adapt via spell-known gates.
- **tbc/paladin/tank-starter.txt** — Protection starter: Righteous Fury missing alarm +
  cooldown row. Also serves as the canonical toolkit example.

## Updating a pack

Re-importing a regenerated string offers an in-place **Update** (UIDs are deterministic and
stable across versions). Uncheck the *Arrangement* category in the update dialog if you've
dragged groups in game. Details: `tools/tbc-weakaura-creator/references/encoding.md`.

## Building new packs

`tools/tbc-weakaura-creator/SKILL.md` — workflow starts from the spec's rotation
(`references/rotation-design.md`), maps each rotation rule to one HUD element, builds through
`scripts/wa_factory.lua`, and verifies with `scripts/wa_lib.lua`. Run `scripts/setup.sh`
once to fetch LibDeflate/LibSerialize (not committed; MIT/zlib-licensed upstream).
